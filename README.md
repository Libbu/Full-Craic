# Thriving Together

Thriving Together is a learner wellness community initiative aiming to showcase wellness resources, sessions, and healthy food options available to students in the learner environment.

The intended consumers of the information in this resource are students, whilst site adminstrators which include instructors, therapists and those responsible for food provision are able to showcase their offerings, planned sessions, or share their wisdom in a blog format.

The website features three sections: The home page takes users to posts on the subjects of wellness, the primary driver behind the initiative. A seperate food section features information available concerning healthy food in the immediate vicinity. A profiles session lists information about site contributors so that users can get to know those responsible for the site content and their background.

## UX

The visual theme of the website was inspired by popular wellness brand colour palattes as identified by [Hello CoCreator](https://hellococreator.com/2023/09/14/best-color-palettes-wellness/)

We encorporated various assets and content relevant to the themes of wellness in order to enhance the user experience; Some examples of these are soothing images promoting the wellness aestehtic on posts, and a coherent colour scheme throughout the website.

The sites navigation has been kept very simple to adhere to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) concept. On arrival at the website users are invited to explore different sections, register or sign in. Once they are signed in the navigation changes slightly so that the option to logout presents instead. Logged-in users are able to leave comments. Site administrators are able to create content and approve comments from users from the Django adminstrative-panel.
